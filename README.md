# ðŸ”¨ Hammer Control

A script that uses [hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon) to create schedules
for [SelfControl](https://github.com/SelfControlApp/selfcontrol).

## Features

### Annoyance

Since `v4` of [SelfControl](https://github.com/SelfControlApp/selfcontrol) couldn't get around
prompting the user for the admin password to start the program, it made auto-scheduling scripts
like [auto-selfcontrol](https://github.com/andreasgrill/auto-selfcontrol) not as effective since
the user would have to consciously start the session. Someone could easily just click cancel and
[SelfControl](https://github.com/SelfControlApp/selfcontrol) would be useless. It was much better
when you could forget about it, so when you got distracted, you wouldn't have the chance to fight
back.

Although I couldn't get around the password prompting problem, something I could do is annoy the
living hell out the of the user if they don't start the
[SelfControl](https://github.com/SelfControlApp/selfcontrol) session.
